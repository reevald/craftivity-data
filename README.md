# Craftivity
For most people, waste is an item that can no longer be used. Garbage disposed of into the environment can cause pollution. They consider garbage as something that must be thrown away, so they often ignore it and just leave the trash without knowing that trash can be used as a useful item. Recycling into crafts can reduce non-biodegradable waste and the amount of
waste that enters the landfill (TPA) and can be used as a source of community income by selling valuable recycled products. With this application we can invite people to process waste into goods of economic value.
